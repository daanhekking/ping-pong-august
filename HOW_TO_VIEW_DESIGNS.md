## Testing Tips

### 1. Test with Different Data Scenarios
- **Empty state:** Start of month (no matches)
- **Few players:** 1-3 players with matches
- **Many players:** 5+ players competing

### 2. Test Responsiveness
- **Desktop:** Full layout with all columns
- **Tablet:** May stack to 1-2 columns
- **Mobile:** Single column, sidebar hidden

### 3. Test Interactions
- **Hover effects:** Cards should lift/highlight
- **Click switching:** Instant design changes
- **Smooth animations:** Transitions should be fluid

### 4. Test Edge Cases
- Player with same name initial
- Very high numbers (1000+ points)
- Very low averages (single digits)
- Tied winners

## Customization Ideas

### Change Default Design
Edit `components/MonthlyWinners.jsx`:
```javascript
const [selectedDesign, setSelectedDesign] = useState('bento') // Your choice
```

### Adjust Colors
Each challenge has unique gradients in Trophy Cards:
```javascript
color: 'from-yellow-500 to-orange-500'  // Most Points
color: 'from-purple-500 to-pink-500'    // Highest ELO
color: 'from-blue-500 to-cyan-500'      // Best Defense
color: 'from-red-500 to-orange-500'     // Single Match
color: 'from-green-500 to-emerald-500'  // ELO Swing
```

### Add More Challenges
Add to the challenges array in each layout component.

### Change Icons
Replace the emoji icons with custom SVG icons if preferred.
